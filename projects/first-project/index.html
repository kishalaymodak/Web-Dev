            AICTE has announced to establish IDEA (Idea Development, Evaluation
            &amp Application) Lab in AICTE approved institutions, encouraging
            students for application of science, technology, engineering and
            mathematics (STEM) fundamentals towards enhanced hands-on
            experience, learning by doing and even product visualization. As a
            common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make
            engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting
            basic training in the 21st century skills.

          <p class="lab-para">
            Our Institute is having its inherent multidisciplinary nature
            through its diverse streams and concurrent laboratory facilities and
            we strongly believe inception of the IDEA Lab would be an added
            feather to this endeavour through its wide spread 24x7 facilities
            bridging the gap between conceptualization and product development
            in actual.The lab aligns with the principles of Industry 4.0 and NEP
            2020, enabling experiential learning and integrating it into the
            curriculum. We plan to extend the lab's resources through
            on-premises infrastructure and emerging technologies. It will serve
            as a platform for multidisciplinary projects, vocational training,
            internships, and hands-on learning experiences forstudents and the
            larger community.

          <p class="lab-para">
            As the IDEA Lab is going to be a long-term intervention aiming to
            transform education imparted in the institution, the proposal must
            spell out a clear vision for the Lab, plan of implementation,
            mobilization of resources, strength and enthusiasm of faculty,
            utilization and expansion of facilities, etc. The alignment of
            activities with larger national goals/ missions/ initiatives or
            industrial requirements or serving disadvantaged sections of society
            etc. and commitment of resources for the same, will impart an edge
            for any proposal. Shortlisted proposals will be subjected to
            scrutiny by a panel of experts before sanctioning of the project by
            AICTE.
